## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the Pi-Gen project from its current state to a robust, feature-rich pixel art generator. By following this plan, the project can be developed incrementally with clear milestones and deliverables, making it easier to track progress and adjust priorities as needed.

The focus on refactoring the core architecture first ensures that the project has a solid foundation for future development, while the phased approach allows for regular releases and feedback cycles. The priority matrix helps in making decisions about feature implementation order, and the risk management plan addresses potential challenges.

With proper execution of this roadmap, Pi-Gen can become a powerful, user-friendly tool for creating pixel art using a node-based approach, fulfilling its goal of providing a Blender-like geometry nodes experience for 2D pixel art creation.

  - [ ] Text Node (renders text as pixels)
  - [ ] Math Nodes (add, multiply, etc.)
  - [ ] Conditional Node (if-then-else logic)

- [ ] **Advanced Rendering**
  - [ ] Layer effects (blur, sharpen, etc.)
  - [ ] Pixel filters (pixelate, dither, etc.)
  - [ ] Animation support (keyframes, timeline)
  - [ ] Export to animated GIF

- [ ] **User Experience**
  - [ ] Node presets and templates
  - [ ] Node search and filtering
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts

| Community Features      | Low    | High   | 6        |

## MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create a node graph with at least the core node types
2. Connections between nodes are type-safe and intuitive
3. The graph evaluates correctly and updates in real-time
4. The output node renders pixel art correctly
5. Users can save their work and export the resulting pixel art
6. The application is stable and performs well with moderate-sized graphs

## Simplified First Iteration

For the very first working prototype, focus on these core features:

1. **Basic Node Graph**
   - Create and position nodes
   - Connect compatible nodes
   - Delete nodes and connections

2. **Minimal Node Set**
   - Output Node
   - Circle Node
   - Color Node

3. **Simple Evaluation**
   - Basic graph traversal
   - Real-time updates

4. **Basic Rendering**
   - Render to canvas
   - Export as PNG

This simplified first iteration provides a working foundation that demonstrates the core concept while being achievable in a short timeframe.

## User Stories for MVP

1. "As a pixel artist, I want to create a circle with customizable radius and color so that I can use it as a building block for my pixel art."

2. "As a user, I want to connect nodes together to create more complex shapes and patterns so that I can create interesting pixel art compositions."

3. "As a designer, I want to adjust parameters in real-time and see the results immediately so that I can iterate quickly on my designs."

4. "As a creator, I want to save my node graph so that I can continue working on it later or share it with others."

5. "As an artist, I want to export my pixel art as a PNG file so that I can use it in other applications or share it online."

These user stories help guide the development of the MVP by focusing on the core user needs and experiences.

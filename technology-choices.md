3. **Compatibility**: Ensure all libraries work well together, especially with React 19's concurrent features.

4. **TypeScript Configuration**: Set up strict TypeScript configuration for maximum type safety.

5. **Testing Strategy**: Implement a testing strategy early, focusing on critical components and logic.

6. **Documentation**: Document code and components as they're developed, not as an afterthought.

7. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks early.

These technology choices provide a solid foundation for building a robust, maintainable, and performant pixel art generator with a node-based interface.
